        I need you to generate a comprehensive summary report of all the feedback provided by the divine reviewers on this Pull Request.

        Please organize the feedback by file and line number, format it as comments that can be posted to GitHub, 
        and ensure each piece of feedback is attributed to the appropriate deity with their domain.

        FORMAT EACH COMMENT LIKE THIS:
        /* 
        * [SECTION: filename:line_number] 
        * [DEITY: Deity name (Domain)]
        * [SCORE: 0-100] 
        * 
        * Feedback details...
